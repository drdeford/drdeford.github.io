<p> I am an Assistant Professor of Data Analytics in the <a href="http://math.wsu.edu">Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a> at Washington State University.
You can download  my C.V. <a href="./files/DeFord_CV.pdf"> here</a> and see the exciting things my students are up to
 <a href="/students">here</a>. </p>
<p> Previously, I was a postdoctoral associate at MIT (CSAIL)
 in the
 <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/gdpgroup/">Geometric Data Processing
 Group</a>, working under <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/">
 Justin Solomon</a>. I was also affiliated with the <a href="https://mggg.org">Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group</a> at Tufts University, 
 working with <a href ="https://https://math.cornell.edu/moon-duchin/">Moon Duchin </a> on the mathematics of redistricting. 
 In 2018,  I earned my Ph.D. in mathematics at Dartmouth College under the supervision of

Dan Rockmore</a>. </p>

I often generate .gifs from the kinds of discrete processes that come up in my research. Some colorful examples (with brief explanations in the mouseover text) below:
