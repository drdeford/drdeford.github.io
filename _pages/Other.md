A User's Guide for Redistricting Problems</a> (2021)
<ul>
<li> Description of modeling methodology for applying the ensemble method using GerryChain to analyze political redistricting problems. This guide was created by  
a team of research fellows that I supervised through the <a href="https://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2021-redistricting-website/">2021 UW Data Science for Social Good program</a>.

Introduction to Discrete MCMC for Redistricting (with Scrabble)</a> (2019). </li>
<ul><li>A friendly and interactive introduction to discrete MCMC methods, concluding with
 applications to political redistricting.  Many of the motivating examples are explained
with Scrabble tiles. Accompanying Sage-interact widgets embedded on a webpage
 <a href="mcmc_intro.php">here</a> and also on

<ul>
<li> This is a guide to GerryChain that walks through the engineering challenges
inherent in generating ensembles of districting plans. Contains numerous examples
and code snippets.  Frequently updated.  </li>

the differences between graphs and networks.  </li></ul>
<li><a href="The_Written_Qual_Book.pdf">The Written Qual Book</a> (with D. Freund) (2017).</li>
<ul> <li> This is a 274 page book containing solutions to all of the written qualifying exam problems
that were given in the Dartmouth Math Department from 2012-2017. In addition to the solutions, we
included 20 pages of expository material on how to survive graduate school and many helpful appendices. There are
also 60 pages of notes, commentary, and context to supplement the formal solutions.  </li></ul>
