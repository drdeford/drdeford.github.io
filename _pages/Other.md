This page collects some of my writing on miscellaneous topics that don't fit naturally onto any of the other pages, sorted roughly chronologically. Some of the longer documents are consequences of my tendency towards procrasti-writing, where I find it much easier to make progress writing about less consequential topics rather than the homework problems, research papers, or referee reports I'm supposed to be generating.
