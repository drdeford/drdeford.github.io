<p>At Vassar College I mostly teach courses related to statistics and data. In these courses I try to introduce interdisciplinary perspectives and to help students discover ways to use quantitative tools to pursue and support their interests.  Previously at WSU I was heavily involved in developing courses for the <a href="https://data-analytics.wsu.edu/">Data Analytics</a> program and I'm particularly passionate about incorporating real-world data and computational tools
 into the classroom. Examples of my course materials can be found in the links below. </p>
  
<p>As a result of my work analyzing gerrymandering I also focus  on the social impact of mathematical modeling in my teaching and have developed several sets of materials for helping 
math students contribute to research around voting rights and political redistricting, which I used while supervising students through the 
<a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/vrdi/">Voting Rights Data Institute</a> and the UW eScience 
 <a href="https://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2021-redistricting-website/">Data Science for Social Good</a> programs. I have also developed and presented
 materials for other instructors on this topic through the <a href="../AMS_EP.md">  AMS Engaged Pedagogy Series</a>. 

<p>In addition to collegiate instruction, the resources I created for   mentoring and coaching middle and high school math teams are <a href="../Problems.md">collected here</a>. For broader descriptions of my perspectives on teaching you can read 
<a href="https://graduate.dartmouth.edu/news/2017/06/teaching-award-2017-recipient-daryl-deford"> this interview</a> about my graduate student teaching award and my
<a href="../files/TP24.pdf"> teaching philosophy </a> statement  from the last time I was on the job market.

<h3> AMS Engaged Pedagogy Series: Mathematical Foundations for Democratic Processes</h3>

In Spring 2023, <a href="https://malmskog.wordpress.com/"> Beth Malmskog</a> and I designed and presented interactive course materials on gerrymandering and computational redistricting for instructors across
 the country together with other experts in the Mathematical Foundations for Democratic Processes program. The resouces we put together are available <a href="../AMS_EP.md"> here</a>.

<h3> UW eScience Institute Data Science for Social Good </h3>

During the 2021 summer term I served as a project lead for the UW DSSG program, supervising a team of graduate student researchers on a project about employing the <a href="https://escience.washington.edu/2021-data-science-for-social-good-projects/">ensemble method to analyze
newly proposed districting plans</a>. The fellows created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KnIEVGlvVENFyZDrxJ2v5j6uEZyFrJT-M3qFufb8E9Q/edit?usp=sharing">detailed guide</a> describing the modeling process and conducted several case studies with real data to evaluate their
methodology. A summary of all of their excellent work is displayed <a href="https://uwescience.github.io/DSSG2021-redistricting-website/"> here</a>.

<h3> Voting Rights Data Institute </h3>

During the 2018 and 2019 summer terms I helped lead the <a href="http://gerrydata.org"> Voting Rights Data Institute</a> organized by the 
MGGG. This is an 8 week program that has included 80+ undergraduate and graduate students focused on problems related
to redistricting. Much of the work was interdisciplinary, combining skills
 from mathematics, political science, computer science, geography, and many others. Some of the material that I 
developed for this program have also been used for stand-alone workshops and tutorials:
<ul> 
<li><b> Introduction to Discrete MCMC (<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/ddeford/MCMC_Intro_plus.pdf">Notes</a>) 
(<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/ddeford/mcmc_intro.php">Software</a>)</b> This is an introduction to discrete MCMC that starts with the definition of a probability distribution and builds 
to discussing how these methods are used in redistricting problems. The text is supplemented with
a large collection of interactive tools for exploring the concepts in more depth. </li>
<li><b>Introduction to GerryChain</b> (<a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/ddeford/GerryChain_Guide.pdf">Notes)
(<a href="https://github.com/vrdi/GerryChain-BootCamp"> Software</a>) (<a href="https://github.com/drdeford/GerryChain-Templates">Templates</a>)</b> 
GerryChain is our open-source software for constructing districting plans with random walks on graph partitions.

<h3> Teaching Award Interview  </h3>

In 2017, I won the <a href="https://graduate.dartmouth.edu/admissions-financial-aid/awards-grants/teaching-award"> Dartmouth Graduate Teaching Award</a>, which is a college-wide recognition for exemplifying the qualities of a college educator. 
An article from the graduate school focused on my teaching experiences can be found: <a href="https://graduate.dartmouth.edu/news/2017/06/teaching-award-2017-recipient-daryl-deford"> here</a>.

<H3>Dartmouth Math Courses</H3>
<ul>

<li>In Fall 2017 I taught <a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m36f17">Math 36: Mathematical Modeling in the Social Sciences</a>. This course
helps students develop and apply quantitative skills to data and problems motivated by the 
social sciences. The main assessments in this course were <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m36f17/assignments.php"> essays</a> 
that required the students to not just analyze models and data but also to construct compelling 
arguments based on their results. The course also including a programming component using
MatLab and Sage. Much of that code is collected <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/~m36f17/resources.php"> here</a>.
  </li>


<li> In each of 2015, 2016, and 2017 I taught sections of the <b> UNSG 100: Graduate Ethics Seminar</b> (<a href="../Ethics">
course website</a>) for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics, computer science, and engineering. The course places
an emphasis on small group discussions and case studies. The focus is on ethical issues in academia, particularly those that are viewed 
differently in other fields, and many of the case studies that I teach are drawn from contemporary events and situations. 
Many of the resources that I have compiled for the course can be found <a href="../Ethics">
here</a>.</li>

<li> In 2017 I taught <b> Math 8: Calculus of Functions of one and Several Variables</b> (<a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m1f15">course website</a>). Some of the interactive Sage programs that I developed for the students are linked below:</li>

<ul>
<li><a href="sage7.html">Taylor Polynomials</a></li>
<li><a href="sage8.html">Taylor Approximation Error</a></li>
<li><a href="sage9.html">Convergence of Infinite Series</a></li>
<li><a href="sage10.html">Infinite Series Error</a></li>

<li><a href="sage12.html">Level Curves, Linearizations, and Gradients</a></li>
<li><a href="sage13.html">Gradient Descent on Surfaces</a></li>

</ul>

For this class, I also put together some notes with fully worked examples on topics that students found particularly challenging:

<ul>
<li><a href="Lagrange_Interpolation.pdf">Polynomial Interpolation</a></li>
<li><a href="taylor_polynomials.pdf">Taylor Polynomials</a></li>
<li><a href="Taylor_ERROR.pdf">Taylor Approximation Error</a></li>
<li><a href="point_to_plane.pdf">Distances from Points to Planes</a></li>

</ul> 

<li> In 2015 I taught <b> Math 1: Calculus with Algebra </b>(<a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m1f15">course website</a>).</li>
I strongly support the use of technology in the classroom and frequently incorporate interactive Sage programs into my classes. Some of the programs from Math 1 
can be found at the following links (adapted from the Sage @interact example page):
<ul>
<li><a href="sage1.html">Function Plotting</a></li>
<li><a href="sage2.html">Secant Plotting</a></li>

<li> Previously at Dartmouth, I served as a teaching assistant for <a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m3w14">Math 3 (Winter 2014)</a>,</li>
<a href="http://math.dartmouth.edu/~m12f13">Math 12 (Fall 2013)</a>,

<H3> Crossroads Math Team </H3>
<p> I volunteer as a coach for the competitive math team at <a href="http://www.crossroadsacademy.org">Crossroads Academy</a> in Lyme, NH. Our weekly meetings are centered around developing problem solving skills and preparing
for competitions and coached the New Hampshire state Math Counts team at Nationals in 2017. Many of the resources that I have put together for the students are collected
<a href="../Problems"> here</a>. </p> 
<p>

 In 2015-16, the Crossroads team won the chapter and state 
Math Counts and Math League competitions as 
well as placing first in New Hampshire and Northern New England on the AMC-8. 
In 2016-17, the students repeated as champions in all of these competitions as well as 
qualifying two students for the national Math Counts competition. The team was equally 
successful in 2017-18 and again qualified a student for the national Math Counts competition.
